# Retail Products Self Checkout System
Machine Learning/Deep Learning
# 1.Business Problem
### 1.1 Problem Description
A self checkout store aims to provide customers with a satisfying experience, prevent time loss, and eliminate long lines and lengthy checkout times by implementing a system that streamlines the shopping experience and keeps track of each customer's choices and preferences without requiring the customer to do anything. Customers can enter a store, browse, and leave without having to stand in line or self-check out at the entrance thanks to self checkout technology in the retail industry. Particularly in the supermarket industry, a new era in retail has begun. Retail Products Self Checkout System is an AI-based approach for grocery superstores which allows customers to conveniently walk in, purchase their products and simply walk out of the stores. Customers need not to wait for long queues for billing or wait for manually self scanning to get the billing done which greatly improves customer happiness and boosts sales.
